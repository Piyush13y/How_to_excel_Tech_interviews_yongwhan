		Welcome! You will find a wealth of information here regarding ICPC at Columbia University.

	<div id="content">
		International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is one of the largest and most prestigious collegiate programming contests in the world. Students compete in teams of three to solve a series of problems of an algorithmic nature. ICPC is a multi-tiered competition. Universities first compete in regional contests. Then top few teams of the regional contests advance to North America Championship (NAC). Top ~15 teams from NAC are invited to the World Finals.
	</div>
	<div id="content">
		Columbia University is in the Greater New York Regional (GNYR). Although the smallest regional in the North America, it is highly competitive. Each year, more than 50 teams attend GNYR contest including teams from four ivy leagues (Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Cornell).
	</div>
	<div id="content">
		In Fall 2022, we will hold an inaugural local contest at Columbia University, which would serve as a "selection contest" to find the top Columbia teams to represent at GNYR. The ICPC Columbia University Local Contest (CULC) is expected to be held in Fall 2022.

		In Fall 2022, Columbia will offer at least one course related to ICPC:
		<ul>
			<li>CS W4995 Section 7: Tech Interview Prep C++ (Instructor: Yongwhan Lim)</li>
		</ul>
		Contingent upon the Columbia team acquiring a ticket to World Finals in NAC and pending an official approval from the CS department and Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), there is a decent, exciting(!) possibility of offering a course on competitive programming for the first time at Columbia, which will directly prepare students for ICPC and interviews from the top hedge funds (and, of course, FAANG)!

	<div id="content">
		Currently, we have, alphabetically ordered by the last name, Kaiheng Dai, Jiajie Lai, Kevin Yang as members of Columbia-fortcoders, the Columbia team invited to NAC 2022, and Yongwhan Lim, Fangxin Lin, and Zhenjia Xu as coaches. Yongwhan will accompany Columbia-fortcoders to NAC to serve the team in order to win a ticket to the World Finals, which is to be held next year!
