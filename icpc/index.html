		Welcome! You will find a wealth of information here regarding ICPC at Columbia University.
		
		International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is one of the largest and most prestigious collegiate programming contests in the world. Students compete in teams of 3 to solve a series of problems of a mathematical/algorithmic nature. ICPC is a multitier competition. Universities compete in regional contests. Then top teams of the regional contests advance to North America Championship (NAC). Finally, top ~15 teams from NAC are invited to the World Finals.

		Columbia University falls into the Greater New York region (GNYR). Although the smallest region in North America, it is highly competitive. Each year, more than 50 teams attend the Greater New York regional contest, including teams from Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, and Yale.
		
		In Fall 2022, we will hold an inaugural local contest at Columbia University, which would serve as a "selection contest". Its main objective is to find the top Columbia teams to represent at GNYR. The ICPC Columbia University Local Contest (CULC) will be held in Fall 2022.
		
		In Fall 2022, Columbia will offer at least one course related to preparing the series of ICPC contests:
		<ul>
			<li>CS W4995 Section 7: Tech Interview Prep C++</li>
		</ul>
		
		Contingent upon the Columbia team acquiring a World Finals ticket in NAC and pending an official approval from the CS department and Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), there is a decent, exciting(!) possibility of offering a course on competitive programming, which will directly prepare students for the ICPC contest series and interviews from top hedge funds (and, of course, FAANG)!
